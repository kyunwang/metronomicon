# Metronome Suite
Currently a playground for testing metronome concepts/forms.

At the moment each 'page' is planned to host it's own segmented setup.


## Planning

- [] Base Timer/Metronome package - To be extracted into a package once ready
  - Potentially switch Tone.js
- [] Basic (Traditional) digital metronome
- [] Polyrythmic metronome
- [] 3D Metronome based on an initial MCU breadboard setup
